Acronim	Explanation
TCGA_project_ID	Identifier of the TCGA cancer type
N	Total number of cancer samples analyzed
Expr/ExprCancer	Median expression in all cancer samples
log2Delta	Log2 ratio of the median expression values
pvalDelta:	P-value of the Wilcoxon test comparing the median expression in each cancer over the global median expression
pval (other)	P-value of the Wilcoxon test comparing the gene expression values in the two groups
pval (cancer)	P-value of the median gene expression compared to a Gamma distribution fit of the medians of all cancer types.
Nsurv	Number of patient in either group compared for the survival analysis (corresponding to the top and bottom quartiles of gene expression)
cox_coef	Coefficient of the Cox regression (proportional hazards model for survival-time); a positive coefficient indicates a worse prognosis and a negative coefficient indicates a protective effect of the gene
pvalSurv	Statistical significance of the Cox regression coefficient
nNorm	Number of healthy samples analyzed
nCancer	Number of cancer samples analyzed
nPrim	Number of primary samples analyzed
nMetas	Number of cancer metastasis samples analyzed
ExprNorm	Median gene expression in healthy samples
ExprPrim	Median gene expression in primary cancer samples
ExprMetas	Median gene expression in cancer metastasis samples
